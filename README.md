## Diagrams
UML can be used to develop diagrams and provide software engineers with ready-to-use, expressive modeling examples. UML gives a standard way to write a system model, covering conceptual ideas. With an understanding of modeling, the use and application of UML can make the software development process more efficient.

* [Sequence diagram](./sequence-diagram.md) - shows a sequence of events between collaborating components
* Usecase diagram - shows who are the actors and the actions in a specific use of a system (ie. "drives a car")
* Class diagram - most software design has data objects that represent how the elements relate.  
* Activity diagram - Activity diagrams are graphical representations of workflows of stepwise activities and actions
* Component diagram - A component diagram depicts how components are wired together to form larger components or software systems 
* State diagram - A state diagram is a type of diagram used in computer science and related fields to describe the behavior of systems.
* Deployment diagram - A deployment diagram in the Unified Modeling Language models the physical deployment of artifacts on nodes.
